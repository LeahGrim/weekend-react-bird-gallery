##First Independent Project using React Language: 
        Birds Engrained in My Mind Forever 
## Description

This project used React useState programming languae to set an array with a series of images with attributes including an id, title, path for picture, picture itself, description, and number of likes. Axios get and put requests were used to update the number of likes and to render the gallery of pictures on the server when the client clicks either the like or dislike button.  On click of the photo, the description appears. This toggle between photo and description is achieved via a javascript ternarny conditional statement, Styling was achieved using CSS. Each child file of the Reaction Functions were styled in their respective .css folders.
